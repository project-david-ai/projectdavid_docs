## Tools Overview

**Tools** allow an assistant to interact directly with external systems, data sources, or perform specific tasks in the real world. For example, a tool could enable interactions with a developer-defined database, API, or service.

There are two distinct categories of tools:

- **Core Platform Tools** (commonly referred to as "tools"): These are built-in functionalities provided by the assistant platform itself.
- **Developer-defined Tools** These are custom extensions created by developers to augment the assistant's capabilities according to specific application needs.


### Platform Tools
| Tool                                              | Description                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [**computer** ](/docs/computer.md)                | The assistant has use of a Linux computer connected to the internet. Very powerful.                                              |
| **waves**                                         | The assistant has access to a vectorized database that acts as long-term memory, document parsing, and cross-conversation recall.|
| [**web_search**](/docs/web_search.md)             | The assistant can use a search engine and other aggregated content on the internet to synthesize responses.                      |
| [**Deep Research**](/docs/deep_research.md)          | Deep Research is designed for queries that require, Multi-hop reasoning, Evidence gathering, and  long-horizon synthesis beyond a single model inference pass                      |
| **file_search**                                   | The assistant can search, retrieve, and utilize files stored within its accessible storage systems.                              |
| [**code_interpreter**](/docs/code_interpreter.md) | The assistant can execute arbitrary Python code, draft documents, and perform data analysis in a secure sandbox environment.     |
