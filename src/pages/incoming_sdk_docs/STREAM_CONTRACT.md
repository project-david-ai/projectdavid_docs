# Event Contract — Streaming Protocol

This document defines the event types emitted by the platform over the streaming
response channel. It is the authoritative reference for SDK consumers and frontend
integrators. Both sides — backend emitter and frontend consumer — are bound by the
shapes described here.

---

## Transport

Events are delivered as a **newline-delimited JSON stream** (NDJSON). Each line is
a self-contained JSON object. Consumers must parse line-by-line and must tolerate
blank lines, which should be skipped silently.

Some clients may receive pre-parsed objects directly (e.g. via the SDK's async
iterator). In that case the line-splitting and JSON parsing step is handled by
the SDK and consumers receive plain objects.

---

## Envelope

Every event has at minimum:

```json
{
  "type": "<event_type>",
  "run_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

| Field    | Type   | Required | Description                                 |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `type`   | string | yes      | Discriminator field. See event types below. |
| `run_id` | string | yes      | Identifies the active inference run.        |

All other fields are type-specific and documented per event below.

---

## Event Types

### `content`

A chunk of assistant response text. Consumers should concatenate these in order
to build the final message.

```json
{
  "type": "content",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "content": "Here is the answer to your question..."
}
```

| Field     | Type   | Description              |
|-----------|--------|--------------------------|
| `content` | string | Partial or full text chunk. |

> **Note:** Some `content` events carry internal status labels from backend mixins
> (e.g. `"📖 Reading scratchpad..."`). These are implementation bleed and should
> be filtered by the consumer. See [Scratchpad Bleed Filter](#scratchpad-bleed-filter).

---

### `reasoning`

Internal chain-of-thought text produced before the final response. Consumers may
display this in a collapsed/secondary UI element.

```json
{
  "type": "reasoning",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "content": "The user is asking about..."
}
```

| Field     | Type   | Description        |
|-----------|--------|--------------------|
| `content` | string | Reasoning text chunk. |

---

### `status`

A lifecycle or tool progress event. Used to drive status indicators in the UI.

```json
{
  "type": "status",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "status": "started",
  "tool": "perform_web_search",
  "message": "Querying search engine..."
}
```

| Field     | Type   | Required | Description                                              |
|-----------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `status`  | string | yes      | See [Status Values](#status-values).                     |
| `tool`    | string | no       | Tool name if this event is tool-scoped.                  |
| `message` | string | no       | Human-readable description of the current operation.     |

#### Status Values

| Backend value       | Normalized UI value | Meaning                        |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| `started`           | `in_progress`       | Operation has begun.           |
| `running`           | `in_progress`       | Operation is ongoing.          |
| `complete`          | `success`           | Operation finished cleanly.    |
| `completed`         | `success`           | Operation finished cleanly.    |
| `done`              | `success`           | Operation finished cleanly.    |
| `failed`            | `error`             | Operation failed.              |
| `error`             | `error`             | Operation failed.              |
| `inference_complete`| `success`           | Full run is complete.          |

---

### `activity`

A higher-level orchestration event describing agent or tool activity. Used to
drive the deep research / activity status component.

```json
{
  "type": "activity",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "tool": "delegate_to_worker",
  "state": "in_progress",
  "activity": "Delegating research task to worker agent..."
}
```

| Field      | Type   | Required | Description                                          |
|------------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `tool`     | string | yes      | Name of the tool or agent component.                 |
| `state`    | string | yes      | Same vocabulary as [Status Values](#status-values).  |
| `activity` | string | no       | Human-readable description of the activity.          |

---

### `scratchpad`

An update to the agent's internal scratchpad / working memory. Consumers should
route these exclusively to the scratchpad UI component — never to the chat bubble.

```json
{
  "type": "scratchpad",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "state": "success",
  "operation": "append",
  "activity": "📌 New strategy entry written.",
  "entry": "📌 GOAL: Find Q3 revenue figures\nENTITIES: Acme Corp\nTOOL CHAIN: perform_web_search → read_web_page"
}
```

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                                                    |
|-------------|--------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `state`     | string | yes      | Same vocabulary as [Status Values](#status-values).            |
| `operation` | string | yes      | One of `read`, `append`, `update`.                             |
| `activity`  | string | no       | Short status label (maps to `message` in UI).                  |
| `entry`     | string | no       | Full scratchpad entry content (maps to `content` in UI).       |

> **UI normalization:** Consumers must remap backend field names before passing
> to the scratchpad component: `state → status`, `activity → message`,
> `entry → content`.

#### Strategy Entry Prefixes

Scratchpad entries always begin with one of these emoji, which consumers can use
as a secondary detection signal:

| Prefix | Meaning             |
|--------|---------------------|
| `📌`   | New strategy entry  |
| `✅`   | Completed step      |
| `🔄`   | Revised strategy    |
| `❓`   | Open question       |
| `⚠️`   | Warning / issue     |
| `☠️`   | Dead end / abort    |

---

### `tool_call_start` / `tool_call_manifest`

Emitted when a tool invocation begins. Consumers use this to show a tool-in-progress
indicator before results arrive.

```json
{
  "type": "tool_call_start",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "tool": "read_web_page"
}
```

| Field  | Type   | Description          |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| `tool` | string | Name of the tool being invoked. |

Routing rules for consumers:

| Tool category   | Examples                                                       | Route to              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Web tools       | `perform_web_search`, `read_web_page`, `scroll_web_page`, `search_web_page` | WebSearchStatus       |
| Scratchpad tools| `read_scratchpad`, `write_scratchpad`, `append_scratchpad`     | Swallow silently      |
| Everything else | `delegate_to_worker`, custom tools                             | DeepResearchStatus    |

---

### `error`

A terminal error event. The run cannot continue.

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "error": "Tool execution timed out."
}
```

| Field   | Type   | Description            |
|---------|--------|------------------------|
| `error` | string | Human-readable error message. |

---

### `generated_file` / `code_interpreter_file`

A file produced by the assistant during code execution or generation.

```json
{
  "type": "generated_file",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "filename": "report.pdf",
  "mime_type": "application/pdf",
  "file_id": "file_xyz",
  "url": "https://...",
  "base64": "<optional base64 data>"
}
```

| Field       | Type   | Required | Description                              |
|-------------|--------|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `filename`  | string | yes      | Original filename.                       |
| `mime_type` | string | yes      | MIME type of the file.                   |
| `file_id`   | string | yes      | Stable identifier for deduplication.     |
| `url`       | string | no       | Download URL if available.               |
| `base64`    | string | no       | Base64-encoded file content if no URL.   |

---

### `hot_code`

A chunk of code being written by the code interpreter.

```json
{
  "type": "hot_code",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "content": "import pandas as pd\n"
}
```

---

### `hot_code_output` / `computer_output`

Output produced by executed code.

```json
{
  "type": "hot_code_output",
  "run_id": "abc123",
  "content": "   name  value\n0  foo   1\n"
}
```

---

## Scratchpad Bleed Filter

The backend occasionally emits scratchpad operation status labels as `type:'content'`
events. These are implementation artifacts and must be swallowed by consumers —
they should never appear in the chat bubble or any status component.

The following strings should be filtered if encountered in a `content` event:

```
📖 Reading scratchpad...
📖 Scratchpad read.
✏️ Updating scratchpad...
✏️ Scratchpad updated.
📝 Appending to scratchpad...
📝 Scratchpad entry written.
Accessing memory...
Memory synchronized.
Scratchpad error:
Validation error:
```

> **Important:** Apply this filter *after* checking for scratchpad entry prefixes
> (`📌 ✅ 🔄 ❓ ⚠️ ☠️`). Legitimate scratchpad entries that happen to contain
> bleed strings must not be swallowed. See routing order below.

---

## Consumer Routing Order

When a `type:'content'` event arrives, consumers must evaluate in this exact order:

1. **Scratchpad entry start?** — does the text begin with `📌 ✅ 🔄 ❓ ⚠️ ☠️`?
   → accumulate into scratchpad buffer, `return`
2. **Mid scratchpad block?** — is an accumulation currently open?
   → append to buffer, `return`
3. **Legacy WebStatusEvent string?** — does the text start with `WebStatusEvent(`?
   → parse and route to status component, `return`
4. **Bleed string?** — does the text match the filter list above?
   → swallow silently, `return`
5. **Default** → render as chat content

---

## Web Tool Scroll Contract

The backend enforces the following constraints on `scroll_web_page` to prevent
unbounded scroll loops:

- **Search-first gate:** `scroll_web_page` on any page beyond page 0 is blocked
  until `search_web_page` has been called on the same URL in the current session.
- **Hard scroll limit:** A maximum of **3** `scroll_web_page` calls are permitted
  per URL per run. Calls beyond this limit return a blocking instruction rather
  than page content.

When either constraint is violated the tool returns a `type:'content'` event
containing a `🛑` prefixed error message with recovery instructions. Consumers
should display this as normal assistant content.

---

## Versioning

This contract is currently **unversioned**. Breaking changes will be noted in the
SDK changelog. A `version` field may be added to the envelope in a future release.
